# CANN - CUDA Accelerated Neural Networks
A lightweight Python library for training neural networks with GPU acceleration.
Built on C++ and CUDA for maximum performance. Supports dense layers, convolutional layers (partial), and multiple optimizers.

# Features

1. Fully connected (dense) layers** for building neural networks  
2. Convolutional layers (partial support; multi-layer backpropagation in development)  
3. Optimizers: SGD, Minibatch, Momentum, with RMSProp in development  
4. Python bindings** via PyBind11 for seamless integration with Python projects  
5. Modular design** for easy extension and creation of custom layers  
6. Check out `layers/`, `optimizers/`, and `tensor.cuh` for the full list of supported operations


# About
I am a computer science student with a strong interest in deep learning. I created CANN for two main reasons:
1. To learn about neural networks and GPU-accelerated computation.
2. To develop reusable code that can be applied in future deep learning projects.

# CANN - CUDA Accelerated Neural Networks (alpha)
A lightweight Python library for training neural networks with GPU acceleration.
Built on C++ and CUDA for maximum performance. Supports fully connected layers, convolutional layers (partial), and multiple optimizers.

# Features
1. Fully connected layers.
2. Convolutional layers (partial support).  
3. Optimizers: SGD, Minibatch, Momentum.  
4. Python bindings via PyBind11 for seamless integration with Python projects.  
5. Modular design for easy extension and creation of custom layers.  
6. Check out `layers/`, `optimizers/`, and `tensor.cuh` for the full list of supported operations

# In Development
1. Multi-layer backpropagation of convolutional layers - right now only one is supported.
2. More optimizers: RMSProp, Adam, etc.
3. Dropout mechanizem.

# About
I am a computer science student with a strong interest in deep learning. I created CANN for two main reasons:
1. To learn about neural networks and GPU-accelerated computation.
2. To develop reusable code that can be applied in future deep learning projects.
